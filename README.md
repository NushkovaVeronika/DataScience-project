This directory includes a few sample datasets to get you started.

california_housing_data*.csv is California housing data from the 1990 US Census; more information is available at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRhYtsvc5eOR2FWNCwaBiKL6suIOrxJig8LcSBbmCbyYsayia_DvPOOBlXZ4CAlQ5nlDD8kTaIDRwrN/pub

mnist_*.csv is a small sample of the MNIST database, which is described at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

anscombe.json contains a copy of Anscombe's quartet; it was originally described in

Anscombe, F. J. (1973). 'Graphs in Statistical Analysis'. American Statistician. 27 (1): 17-21. JSTOR 2682899.

**Overview**  
This project analyzes food price trends over the past four years in at least three different countries from distinct regions of the world (e.g., USA, Rwanda, and the Netherlands). The goal is to collect, process, and study the data using time-series analysis techniques and visualize the relationships between food prices in different countries.

**Tools & technologies**

**Python** (for data processing and analysis)  
**tsfresh** (for time-series feature extraction)  
**Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)  
**Matplotlib & Plotly** (for visualization)  
**NetworkX** (for correlation network construction) 


**Expected outcome**  
This project will produce a comprehensive dataset of food prices across different regions, along with time-series feature analysis to highlight key trends and anomalies. Additionally, network visualizations will be developed to demonstrate the relationships between food prices in different countries, providing insights into global food price dynamics and potential influencing factors.
